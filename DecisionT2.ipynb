    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
    "   - The descriptive statistics give us an overview of the numerical variables in the dataset, including the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values.\n",
    "   - We can observe that some variables, such as Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, and Age, have minimum values of zero, which may indicate missing or invalid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - We checked for missing values and found that there are zeros in several columns, particularly in SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI. These zeros are likely to represent missing data rather than actual measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distribution of the Target Variable (Outcome)**:\n",
    "   - The distribution of the target variable 'Outcome' shows that there are more non-diabetic (Outcome = 0) patients than diabetic (Outcome = 1) patients in the dataset.\n",
    "   - This indicates a class imbalance, with more negative instances compared to positive instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distribution of Numerical Variables**:\n",
    "   - The histograms show the distribution of numerical variables.\n",
    "   - We can observe some variables, like Pregnancies and Age, have a somewhat skewed distribution.\n",
    "   - There are also a significant number of zero values in variables like Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relationships Between Numerical Variables**:\n",
    "   - The pairplot visualizes the relationships between numerical variables.\n",
    "   - We can see some separation between diabetic and non-diabetic patients in certain scatter plots, indicating potential predictive power in these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "- We need to handle missing values, particularly the zeros in variables like Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI. We can either impute them or consider them as a separate category.\n",
    "- We can further explore the relationships between variables to select the most predictive features for our decision tree model.\n",
    "- Since there's a class imbalance, we need to choose an appropriate evaluation metric for our model. Given the importance of correctly identifying diabetic patients (positive cases), we may prioritize recall or F1-score over accuracy."
