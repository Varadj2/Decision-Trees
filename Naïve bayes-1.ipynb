    "Bayes' theorem, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or beliefs about related events. Bayes' theorem is expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the conditional probability of event \\( A \\) occurring given that event \\( B \\) has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the conditional probability of event \\( B \\) occurring given that event \\( A \\) has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) and \\( P(B) \\) are the probabilities of events \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) occurring independently of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem allows us to update our beliefs or prior knowledge about the likelihood of an event \\( A \\) occurring, given new evidence or information \\( B \\). Here's a breakdown of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability, representing our initial belief about the likelihood of event \\( A \\) occurring.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the likelihood function, representing the probability of observing evidence \\( B \\) given that event \\( A \\) has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the marginal likelihood or evidence, representing the total probability of observing evidence \\( B \\).\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the posterior probability, representing the updated belief about the likelihood of event \\( A \\) occurring after observing evidence \\( B \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is widely used in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, for tasks such as classification, regression, and hypothesis testing. It provides a principled way to incorporate new evidence into existing knowledge and make more informed decisions."
